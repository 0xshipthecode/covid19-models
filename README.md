# covid19-models

Overview of available epidemiological forecasting models and basic properties. We try to find, understand and record here all modeling efforts that we come across with publicly accessible model results or code.

Note: this is a *best-effort overview*, please help with corrections if you see mistakes. Open an issue if you see a problem.

## Contributions

Any help in identifying other modeling efforts is appreciated, especially model efforts in non-English languages. Please fork the repository, add your contribution and send a PR.

## Model information

Please include at least:

- links to a descriptive model webpage and to code if available
- which phenomena does the model focus on?
- what key types of data are used by the model
- how does the model handle uncertainty?
- who is developing the model?

See `model_template.md` for a template.
